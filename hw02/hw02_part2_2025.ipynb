    "# Defining functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a very simple function that converts a proportion to a percentage by multiplying it by 100.  For example, the value of `to_percentage(.5)` should be the number 50.  (No percent sign.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A function definition has a few parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `def`\n",
    "It always starts with `def` (short for **def**ine):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Name\n",
    "Next comes the name of the function.  Let's call our function `to_percentage`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def to_percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Signature\n",
    "Next comes something called the *signature* of the function.  This tells Python how many arguments your function should have, and what names you'll use to refer to those arguments in the function's code.  `to_percentage` should take one argument, and we'll call that argument `proportion` since it should be a proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion)\n",
    "\n",
    "We put a colon after the signature to tell Python it's over.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Documentation\n",
    "Functions can do complicated things, so you should write an explanation of what your function does.  For small functions, this is less important, but it's a good habit to learn from the start.  Conventionally, Python functions are documented by writing a triple-quoted string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Body\n",
    "Now we start writing code that runs when the function is called.  This is called the *body* of the function.  We can write anything we could write anywhere else.  First let's give a name to the number we multiply a proportion by to get a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `return`\n",
    "The special instruction `return` in a function's body tells Python to make the value of the function call equal to whatever comes right after `return`.  We want the value of `to_percentage(.5)` to be the proportion .5 times the factor 100, so we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",

    "You are a data analyst at an online retail company. The company generates a large amount of sales data daily, which is stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. Your task is to write a Python program that reads these sales data files, performs a simple analysis, and generates a summary report.\n",

    "*   `InvoiceNo`: The invoice number.\n",
    "*   `StockCode`: The product code.\n",
    "*   `Quantity`: The quantity of the product per transaction.\n",

    "1.  **Read the Data File:**\n",
    "    *   Write a function `read_sales_data(file_path)` that takes a file path as an argument.\n",
    "    *   Use the `open()` function in read mode (`'r'`) to open the specified CSV file.\n",
    "    *   Read the file content line by line and parse each line, converting it into a list of dictionaries. Each row of data should be parsed into a dictionary where the keys are the column names and the values are the corresponding data.\n",
    "    *   The function should return this list of dictionaries.\n",
    "    *   **Note:** The first line of the CSV file is the header; you need to handle it correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Analyze the Data:**\n",
    "    *   Write a function `analyze_data(sales_data)` that takes the data returned by the `read_sales_data` function.\n",
    "    *   In this function, you need to calculate the following metrics:\n",
    "        *   **Total Revenue:** Calculate the total sales amount for all transactions (`Quantity` * `UnitPrice`).\n",
    "        *   **Best-Selling Product:** Identify the product with the highest total quantity sold (based on `StockCode`).\n",
    "        *   **Top Country by Sales:** Find the country with the highest total sales revenue.\n",
    "    *   The function should return a dictionary containing these three metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Generate the Report:**\n",
    "    *   Write a function `generate_report(analysis_results)` that takes the analysis results from the `analyze_data` function and print the output.\n",
    "    *   The report should include:\n",
